Pinned Hugging Face revisions for the models `tests/test_fit.py` measures,
plus the on-disk cache layout shared by the test suite and the pre-fetch
helper (`fetch_configs.py`).

Why this file exists
--------------------
The repository does not redistribute upstream `config.json` files, and must not
start. Each one is a third-party file arriving under its model's licence
(Apache-2.0, MIT, the Llama 3.x Community Licence, or the Gemma Terms of Use).
Committing copies would make this project a redistributor and pull those inbound
obligations -- licence copies, modification notices, attribution, notice-file
text, use-policy pass-through -- into the release artifact, to get unit tests to
pass. There is no engineering benefit that trades against that.

So the suite fetches what it needs at run time and caches it under
`tests/data/.cache/configs/`, which `.gitignore` excludes (`.cache/` matches at
any depth). `tests/data/configs/` -- where the fixtures used to live -- is
ignored by name as well, so a stray re-fetch cannot be committed back into the
old location.

A config that cannot be fetched is always a *skip*, never a failure. Gated repo,
no `HF_TOKEN`, no network, HTTP 429 rate limit -- none of those say anything
about the calculator under test, so none of them should redden a run. If you are
looking at a skipped test, the fix is a token or a network route, never a
committed config.

Why the revisions are pinned
----------------------------
`test_fit.py` asserts on exact model dimensions (hidden size, head_dim,
num_key_value_heads, expert counts). Tracking `main` would let an upstream
config edit silently change what those assertions measure -- the failure would
look like a calculator regression. A pinned commit makes the fetched bytes
reproducible.

Refreshing a pin
----------------
Revisions are repository commit SHAs. The metadata endpoint is public even for
gated repositories, so no token is needed to resolve one:

    curl -s https://huggingface.co/api/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
        | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["sha"])'

Bump the SHA here, re-run the suite, and fix up any dimension assertion that
legitimately changed.

What each model is here to cover
-------------------------------
This module is the single source of truth: both `test_fit.py` and
`fetch_configs.py` read it, so the two cannot drift on which models are needed.
Each entry earns its place by exercising a distinct calculator path -- do not
drop one without checking what stops being covered.
